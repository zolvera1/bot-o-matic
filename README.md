# BOT-O-MAT
  I wrote this project using css, javascript, jquery, html, and used a css framework called bulma. It was a fun experinece using what I learned about jquery from class into a project. 
I am also planning on implementing this project using react on my own time! 

Some of the features given...
- Collect a name and robot type from user.
- Instantiate a Robot of the type provided by the user with the name provided by the user
  - for example: Bipedal, Larry
- Set up methods on Robot to complete tasks from the provided list
- Clear all robots from screen
- Delete robot card
- Get random and unique tasks

## Robot
Robot completes tasks and removes them from the list when they are done (i.e. enough time has passed since starting the task).

## Tasks
Tasks have a description and an estimated time to complete.

```

## Features to add once the core functionality is complete
Be creative and have fun! Use this list or create your own features.
- Allow users to create multiple robots at one time
- Create a leaderboard for tasks completed by each Robot
- Create tasks specific for each robot type, this could work in conjunction with the leaderboard. For e.g. robots that are assigned tasks that their type can’t perform won’t get “credit” for finishing the task.
- Add persistance for tasks, bots and leaderboard stats
